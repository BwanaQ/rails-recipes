  <h1>Ruby on Rails Recipes</h1>
</div>

A collection of recipes for solid Ruby on Rails applications. Extracted from
dozens of production apps and 10,000+ hours of deliberate Ruby on Rails practice
since 2005.


The Recipes
-----------

#### [Concerns](pages/concerns.html)

I know, I know,... Some people are concerned when they see the `concerns` folder
in your app. Read this to find out why I think they are useful anyways.


#### [Naming and organizing your user facing code](pages/naming_and_organizing_your_user_facing_code.html)

Let use cases and roles drive how you organize and name your Controllers and Views.


#### [Outcome.rb](pages/outcome.html)

Advanced return values for complex processing. Includes a success indicator,
return value and user messages in a uniform interface.


#### [Permissions and user roles](pages/permissions_and_user_roles.html)

How to manage user roles and permissions.


#### [Ruby coding style guide](pages/ruby_coding_style_guide.html)

Follow this style guide to make your code easy to read and reason about.

### Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
