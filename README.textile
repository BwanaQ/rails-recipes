h1. Rails Recipes

This repository contains a number of recipes I developed for my Rails applications.

* "Request Environment":master/request-environment: store your request params like current user in a way that is accessible to your models.
* "Restful Permissions":master/restful-permissions: A clean and object oriented way to handle permissions in views and controllers.
